These are brackets that allow you to mount a Power Supply to one side of the Delta on the bottom 2 pipes.
For the Extended Brackets, you will need to mirror 1 of them for the other side.  The extended brackets
should work better for smaller Build Diameter like 200mm.  See the animation file for how these look assembled.
