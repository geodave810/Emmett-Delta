These are brackets that allow you to mount a Power Supply to one side of the Delta on the bottom 2 pipes.
After looking at the assembly of parts for a 210mm Heat Bed, looks like the design will have to be adjusted
to fit between the vertex parts.  I should be able to fix that with adding some extended tabs where it
connects to the P/S.
