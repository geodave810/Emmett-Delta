# Emmett-Delta
Delta 3d Printer using Electrical Metal Tubing (EMT)

For details about this Delta 3d printer see the build log & discussion here:
<a href="http://www.openbuilds.com/builds/emmett-delta.3052/">Emmett-Delta</a>

I have added an animation file that shows how all the parts go together for Option 3 build
The animation was created using <a href="https://github.com/PRouzeau/OpenSCAD-Delta-Simulator">PRouzeau OpenSCA-Delta-Simulator</a>

10/31/2016 Update:
There are several different build options for this Delta & I am just getting
all these files together on Github.  Each Option will have its own file folder.
There is a BOM spreadsheet file, but it needs to be updated some.

Option 1:
3/4" EMT Horizontals and V-Slot 2060 extrusions for the Verticals

Option 2:
3/4" EMT Horizontals & 4x 1/2" EMT Verticals on each column.

Option 3:
1/2" EMT Horizontals & 4x 1/2" EMT Verticals on each column.
(This is the build I am doing)
