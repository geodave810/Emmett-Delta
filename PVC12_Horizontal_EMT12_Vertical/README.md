These are the files you need if configuring this build for 1/2" PVC for the Horizontals & 1/2" EMT for the Verticals.

The big advantage to this configuration is drill the mounting holes should be easier with PVC than with EMT.

For a 300mm Build plate, the horizontal PVC would only be 16.4" long & only 6.4" between Vertex screw hole &
where the build plate connects to Heat Bed Bracket.

See the HB_Bracket & PS_Brackets folder fot the bracket to hold the Heat Bed & Power Supply
