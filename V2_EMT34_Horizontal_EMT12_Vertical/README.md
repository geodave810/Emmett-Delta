In an effort to make the vertex parts more consistant between the different configurations,
I am modifying the 3/4" EMT Horizontals.  This will use a quite a bit less plastic as well.
The Vertex_2x_EMT34H_4xEMT12V_V2_rev101.stl file can be used for bottom or top but has no belt adjustment
TheVertexTop_2x_EM34TH_4xEMT12V_V2_rev101.stl has Belt adjustment & also uses 2 pipes on each side.

The Heat Bed Brackets can be found in the folder:
