Update Info 5/21/2017

The build I am planning should have a build diameter of 200mm x 590mm height.  I am currently redoing the vertex parts for this version & printing them this week.

EMT Cut Lengths:
12x 700mm Lengths for Vertical 1/2" EMT
12x 266.5mm Lengths for Horizontal 1/2" EMT

This folder consists of the files specific to the 1/2"EMT Horizontal & 1/2" EMT Vertical Build.
The Filament Holder, HeatBed Brackets, P/S Brackets & various jigs can be found in folders under the main folder.

The reason they are not in this folder is because the openscad used to generate the STL files
has options for the various builds.
