This folder consists of the files specific to the 1/2"EMT Horizontal & 1/2" EMT Vertical Build.
The Filament Holder, HeatBed Brackets, P/S Brackets & various jigs can be found in folders under the main folder.

The reason they are not in this folder is because the openscad used to generate the STL files
has options for the various builds.
