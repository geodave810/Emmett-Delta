This is a frame assembly that helps to pull all the parts together.
With this method, the horizontal 1/2" EMT should be able to stay in place
by connecting the vertex parts to this & using the vertex brackets.
This will save you from having to drill holes thru the horizontal 1/2" EMT.

The openscad source file references Vertex_2x_EM12TH_4xEMT12V_rev100.stl

Before printing any of these parts, I would recommend printing the file:
BottomDoveTailFrame_Test_Rev28.stl first.
This should give you a good indication of the fit of the dovetails & screw holes.

The holes are sized for M4 or #8 screws on the dovetail vertex mounting holes
The locknut traps are sized for #8 locknuts.  Change the variable:
M4Nut_OD = 9.4;   //If you want to use M4 screws & locknuts
The holes for mounting electronics brackets or electronics on the inside frame
are sized for M3 Screws.
